# Assignment 6 - String Operations GUI #

You should now have your number operations working in you GUI. Now it's time to add the String operations.

The application will have a 2nd screen or tab (probably use a TabPane) that will have a text field for inputing a list of strings and a button for executing the `palindrome` method. It will also output to either a new TextArea/Label or you may use the existing one if you'd like. Just like before make sure the user is unable to break anything with the UI or the inputs they enter. Validate the input. Also have some way for the user to clear the text in the TextField if they want. 

> IMPORTANT: Make sure you separate the controller methods into 2 classes, `NumberController` and `StringController`. This will require some refactoring.
