## JavaFX - Adding Events ##

Now that you have your UI laid out for you project we can start wiring everything up. You will need to write events in your Controller class for all of you number operation `Button`s, `TextField`s, `TextArea`s, `Label`s, etc. 

> IMPORTANT: Please make sure you are validating user input and that you do simple quality configurations like if you have a text area for output, make sure the user can't edit it. Don't let the user crash your application or cause weird behavior. Make sure to clear input TextFields too after a user has submitted them successfully

The user will be able to simply input a list of numbers. This list could be space separated list in a TextField or you could just have a box and the user can add them 1 at a time by clicking a button. It's up to you.

After the numbers are added the User will be able to click any of the number operation buttons and see the results.
