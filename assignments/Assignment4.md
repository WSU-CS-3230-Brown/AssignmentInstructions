# Assignment 4 #

> NOTE: There are 2 sections here. They are almost identical but one is specific to Swing while the other is JavaFX. I am recommending you use Swing.

## Getting Started with Swing UI ##

The goal of this assignment is to lay the ground work for our GUI in the project. We'll start with basic layout and in later assignments will add more to it. 

Create and modify your main swing window to have all the components needed to implement your ***number operations*** in the gui. I'm going to allow you the creative freedom to lay this out how you'd like but I'll give you some basic guidelines.

You will need:
1. Some way to accept input for the users list of numbers (JTextField)
2. Buttons for each of the operations in the number cruncher
3. Some way to display the results cleanly (JTextArea, JLabels, etc.)
   * min
   * max
   * evens
   * odds
   * sum
   * standard deviation
   * five number summary

This will be graded on how cleanly your components are laid out. I wont grade on any style decisions but I will grade on things being legible and that no components are overlapping or cut off in the layout. Basically I'm looking that to took some pride in your creation.
