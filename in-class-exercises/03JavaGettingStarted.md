# In Class Exercise - Java Getting Started #

In this exercise we will create a simple "Hello, world" java jar using only the command line and a source code editor (NO IDE). This will be done as a class but everyone will submit their code via their assignment github repo. More instructions will be given in class. We'll work through this together. Part of this exercise will cover how we go about submitting assignments correctly, including how to create a branch, make commits and then submit a pull request on the repo.
